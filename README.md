# Lunar-Lander-Deep-Expected-Sarsa
This project is about using deep expected sarsa with tensorflow to solve the lunar lander problem with hyperparameter tuning and result's analysis

# These points are important read them please:

- all data and models are in results folder 

- folder tests is just for you if you want to test something

- if you want to plot the data, you don't need tensorflow just python and matplotlib

- you need TensorFlow 2.3 for it to work

# the code is structured this way: 

- imports

- replay buffer class

- expected sarsa  network

- softmax and argmax helper functions

- agent class 

- lunarlander class

- loading, parsing plotting helper functions

- run experiment function for testing egreedy and softmax

- run experiment function for testing batch size and replay steps

- run experiment normal run 

- setting all learning parameters, data and the call for the run experiment function

- cell for loading data and defining the loaded variable (run it before trying to plot or test the agent)

- cell to compute averages

- cell to plot same : plot all data (rewards, loss, episode steps) for each type of tests

- cell for choosing best batch size and number of replay steps

- cell for choosing best softmax tau and step-size 

- cell for choosing best e-greedy epsilon and step-size

- INFO CELL (IMPORTANT READ IT PLEASE)

- cell to load and reconstruct model

- cell to plot data of best model

- cell to test the agent

- thank you :)
